The nearly symmetrically wavy line gives the sense you could separate the two pieces. Reverse the side it stands on and you create a whole new look. Each is hand carved - no two are alike. Solid eco friendly Monkey Pod wood can be used as an end table, decor piece, stand, or as a stool. Carved from a single piece of Monkey Pod wood and finished with Eco Friendly Livos Clear Oil, these pieces are appealing to the viewer from any angle. Each piece is a Work of Art! Craftspeople from the Chiang Mai area in Northern Thailand create these one-of-a-kind pieces with the simplest of tools. After each Monkey Pod Wood (Acacia, Koa, Rain Tree grown for wood carving) piece is kiln dried, carved and sanded, it is rubbed in Livos Clear Oil creating a highly water resistant and food safe finish. This natural oil is translucent, so the wood grain detail is highlighted; this is then polished to a matte finish. There is no oily feel and cannot bleed into carpets, as it contains natural lacs. No chemicals are used in the process, ever. This piece is packaged with cartons from recycled cardboard with no plastic or other fillers; and is made from the thick branches of the quick-growing Acacia tree in Thailand - where each branch is cut and carved to order (allowing the tree to continue growing.) The color and grain of your item will be unique, and may include small checks or cracks that occur when the wood is dried. Sizes are approximate. Products could have visible marks from tools used, patches from small repairs, knot holes, natural inclusions, and\/or worm holes. There may be various separations or cracks on your piece when it arrives. There may be some slight variation in size, color, texture, and finish color.Only listed product included.","shipment_cost":"Free Shipping!","shipment_term":"Ready to ship to the Continental U.S. in 2 - 5  days.","seller":{"id":"1672","name":"Haussmann Inc.","houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/products\/buy-on-houzz\/seller--Haussmann-Inc.-"},"images":["http:\/\/st.houzz.com\/simgs\/ef8158e303a8641f_4-4609\/contemporary-accent-and-garden-stools.jpg"],"properties":{"Category":"Accent And Garden Stools","Color":"Clear","Depth":"10\"","Designer":"Haussmann","Height":"18\"","Manufactured By":"Kammika","Materials":"Sustainable Monkey Pod Wood","Sold By":"Haussmann Inc.","Style":"Contemporary","Width":"14\""}},{"id":"378627","categories":[],"houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/11301194\/Circle-of-Life-Garden-Stool-Navy-Blue-asian-accent-and-garden-stools","name":"Circle of Life Garden Stool, Navy Blue","price":"290","currency":"USD","description":"This circle of life garden stool will add depth and unique style to any room in your home.

Very impressive, this elegant piece can be appreciated from any angle. Use it as an end table, display stand or stool; two together can serve as a coffee table. Livos Oak oil finish creates a water resistant and food safe matte finish. The color and grain shows through in brownish reddish tones. The light and dark portions turn to darker shades of brown over time and the alkaline in the oils creates a honey orange color. Hand carved from a piece of Monkey Pod wood, these are easily moved around for use in any situation. Each piece is a Work of Art! Craftspeople from the Chiang Mai area in Northern Thailand create these pieces with the simplest of tools. After each sustainable Monkey Pod wood (Acacia, Koa, Rain Tree grown for wood carving) stump is kiln dried, carved and sanded by Thai artisans, it is rubbed in Livos Oak tone oil. These natural oils are translucent, so the wood grain detail is highlighted. There is no oily feel and cannot bleed into carpets, as it contains natural lacs. Hand crafted from a sustainable Monkey Pod wood species, we make minimal use of electric hand sanders in the finishing process. All products are dried in solar and or propane kilns. No chemicals are used in the process, ever. After each stool is carved, kiln dried, sanded, and hand rubbed with Livos oil, they are packaged with cartons from recycled cardboard with no plastic or other fillers. The color and grain of your piece of Nature will be unique, and may include small checks or cracks that occur when the wood is dried. Sizes are approximate. Products could have visible marks from tools used, patches from small repairs, knot holes, natural inclusions or holes. There may be various separations or cracks on your piece when it arrives. There may be some slight variation in size, color, texture, and finish color.Only listed product included.","shipment_cost":"Free Shipping!","shipment_term":"Ready to ship to the Continental U.S. in 2 - 5  days.","seller":{"id":"1672","name":"Haussmann Inc.","houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/products\/buy-on-houzz\/seller--Haussmann-Inc.-"},"images":["http:\/\/st.houzz.com\/simgs\/0261ea0203a864b3_4-4758\/mediterranean-accent-and-garden-stools.jpg"],"properties":{"Category":"Accent And Garden Stools","Color":"Gold","Depth":"12\"","Designer":"Haussmann","Height":"20\"","Manufactured By":"Kammika","Materials":"Sustainable Monkey Pod Wood","Sold By":"Haussmann Inc.","Style":"Mediterranean","Width":"12\""}},{"id":"378645","categories":[],"houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/22564071\/Contemporary-Style-Classy-Styled-Beautiful-Metal-Stool-Home-Decor-49155-industrial-accent-and-garden-stools","name":"Contemporary Style Classy Styled Beautiful Metal Stool Home Decor 49155","price":"74.95","currency":"USD","description":"Contemporary inspired style classy styled beautiful metal stool living and family room home accent decor","shipment_cost":"Free Shipping!","shipment_term":"Ready to ship to the Continental U.S. in 2 - 7  days.","seller":{"id":"1518","name":"GwG Outlet","houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/products\/buy-on-houzz\/seller--GwG-Outlet"},"images":["http:\/\/st.houzz.com\/simgs\/5d91830004bdbf97_4-1497\/industrial-accent-and-garden-stools.jpg"],"properties":{"Category":"Accent And Garden Stools","Depth":"15\"","Designer":"Benzara","Height":"18\"","Manufactured By":"Benzara","Materials":"Metal","Sold By":"GwG Outlet","Style":"Industrial","Width":"15\""}},{"id":"378646","categories":[],"houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/7210117\/Small-Rope-Garden-Stool-Turquoise-asian-accent-and-garden-stools","name":"Small Rope Garden Stool, Turquoise","price":"358","currency":"USD","description":"You've planted your garden, laid the stone path, arranged the outdoor furniture but there is still  something missing.

Sustainable Monkey Pod wood is finished in Livos Oak Oil creating a water resistant and food-safe matte finish. The light and dark portions of wood turn to darker shades of brown over time and the alkaline in the oils creates a honey orange color.

This eco friendly sturdy and versatile functional art piece is easily moved around for use in any situation, and is appealing to the viewer from any angle. Designed for standalone use or in groups, each is a work of art itself; it can be lit from above or below to show off the unique curves and grain of the wood. Solid Monkey Pod wood is allowed to dry and crack naturally. Each piece is a Work of Art, Functional Sustainable Monkey Pod Wood Eco Friendly Art! After each Monkey Pod wood (Acacia, Koa, Rain Tree grown for wood carving) piece is dried, carved and sanded, it is rubbed in Livos oil. There is no oily feel and cannot bleed into carpets. This piece is packaged with cartons from recycled cardboard with no plastic or other fillers; and is made from the branches of the Acacia tree in Thailand - where each branch is cut and carved to order (allowing the tree to continue growing). Your piece of Nature will be unique, and may include small checks or cracks that occur when the wood is dried. Sizes are approximate. Products could have visible marks from tools used, patches from small repairs, knot holes, natural inclusions or holes. There may be various separations or cracks on your piece when it arrives.

This sturdy versatile functional art piece can be used as an end table, display stand or stool; two together can serve as a coffee table. Use it as guest seating, a side table, window seat - the possibilities are endless! Livos Walnut Oil creates a water resistant and food-safe matte finish. Color ranges from medium to dark Walnut brown tones that will darken as the wood ages. Hand carved from a piece of Monkey Pod wood, these are easily moved around for use in any situation. Each piece is a Work of Art! Craftspeople from the Chiang Mai area in Northern Thailand create these pieces with the simplest of tools. After each sustainable Monkey Pod wood (Acacia, Koa, Rain Tree grown for wood carving) stump is kiln dried, carved and sanded by Thai artisans, it is rubbed in Livos Walnut tone oil. These natural oils are translucent, so the wood grain detail is highlighted. There is no oily feel and cannot bleed into carpets. Hand crafted from a sustainable Monkey Pod wood species, we make minimal use of electric hand sanders in the finishing process. All products are dried in solar or propane kilns. No chemicals are used in the process, ever. After each stool is carved, kiln dried, sanded, and hand rubbed with Livos oil, they are packaged with cartons from recycled cardboard with no plastic or other fillers. The color and grain of your piece of Nature will be unique, and may include small checks or cracks that occur when the wood is dried. Sizes are approximate. Products could have visible marks from tools used, patches from small repairs, knot holes, natural inclusions or holes. There may be various separations or cracks on your piece when it arrives.

A single piece of Monkey Pod wood finished with Livos Agate Grey oil, these eco friendly pieces are sturdy to use as an end table, stand or stool. Appealing to the viewer from any angle, each is a Work of Art! Craftspeople from the Chiang Mai area in Northern Thailand create these pieces with the simplest of tools. Sustainable Monkey Pod wood (Acacia, Rain Tree grown for wood carving) is dried, carved, sanded, and rubbed with Livos Agate Grey tone oil that is polished to a water resistant and food safe matte finish. The oil makes the wood turn to an antique white look with a light grey patina finish. The light portions of wood turn to shades of beige, and the dark lightens to shades of brown with a light transparent grey top coat over the white antique looking undercoat. There is no oily feel; and cannot bleed into carpets, as it contains natural lacs. Made from the branches of the Acacia tree, where each branch is cut and carved to order (allowing the tree to continue growing), we make minimal use of electric hand sanders in the finishing process. All products are dried in solar or propane kilns. No chemicals are used in the process, ever. Each piece is packaged with cartons from recycled cardboard with no plastic or other fillers. The color and grain of your piece of Nature will be unique, and may include small checks or cracks that occur when the wood is dried. Sizes are approximate. Products could have visible marks from tools used, patches from small repairs, knot holes, natural inclusions or holes. There may be various separations or cracks on your piece when it arrives. There may be some slight variation in size, color, texture, and finish.Only listed product included.","shipment_cost":"Free Shipping!","shipment_term":"Ready to ship to the Continental U.S. in 2 - 5  days.","seller":{"id":"1672","name":"Haussmann Inc.","houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/products\/buy-on-houzz\/seller--Haussmann-Inc.-"},"images":["http:\/\/st.houzz.com\/simgs\/8541e02403a8649c_4-4735\/craftsman-accent-and-garden-stools.jpg"],"properties":{"Category":"Accent And Garden Stools","Color":"Grey","Depth":"14\"","Designer":"Haussmann","Height":"30\"","Manufactured By":"Kammika","Materials":"Sustainable Monkey Pod Wood","Sold By":"Haussmann Inc.","Style":"Craftsman","Width":"14\""}},{"id":"378832","categories":[],"houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/16651567\/Silk-Plants-Direct-Wood-Mosaic-Stool-Pack-of-1-traditional-accent-and-garden-stools","name":"Silk Plants Direct Wood Mosaic Stool (Pack of 1)","price":"434.99","currency":"USD","description":"Pack of 1.

Each is hand carved and has a unique story to tell. Finished in translucent Livos Walnut Oil allows the wood color and grain shows through. This elegant sturdy piece can serve as an end table, display stand, or a stool. They are designed for use stand alone or in groups, and are appealing to the viewer from any angle. No two are alike. The wood is from sustainable sources, and eco friendly Livos finishes create functional works of eco friendly art. Craftspeople from the Chiang Mai area in Northern Thailand create these pieces with the simplest of tools. Each Sustainable Monkey Pod Wood (Acacia, Koa, Rain Tree grown for wood carving) piece is kiln dried, carved, sanded, and rubbed in Livos Walnut tone oil polished to a water resistant and food safe matte finish. The color ranges from medium to dark Walnut brown tones that will darken as the wood ages; the wood grain detail is highlighted. There is no oily feel, and cannot bleed into carpets. Made from the thick branches of the quick-growing Acacia tree - where each branch is cut and carved to order (allowing the tree to continue growing), all products are dried in solar or propane kilns. No chemicals are used in the process, ever. This piece is packaged with cartons from recycled cardboard with no plastic or other fillers. As this is a natural product, the color and grain of your piece of Nature will be unique, and may include small checks or cracks that occur when the wood is dried. Sizes are approximate. Products could have visible marks from tools used, patches from small repairs, knot holes, natural inclusions or holes. There may be various separations or cracks on your piece when it arrives. There may be some slight variation in size, color, texture, and finish color.

The wood is originally from hand-painted tropical fishing boats. The iron frame, reclaimed from dismantled bridges, adds to the cool sophistication. A great piece for the breakfast bar in your kitchen.    Benefits:    The Fin and Tonic Bar Stool is handmade from the wood of tropical fishing boats and iron from yesterday\u2019s bridges. Our pieces, large and small, are playful, due to the color and weathering inherent in each boat we buy; sophisticated by nature of our in-house design team, and made to last a lifetime: We use only the highest-quality fishing-boat teak.    Care, cleaning and technical information:  Highly durable marine grade wood is perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. We have treated this item with a water based organic semi-gloss finish therefore cleaning is very simple.  Low in harmful VOC's (volatile organic compounds) it is comparable to oil-based varnish for its high resistance to abrasion, water and solvents. This item cleans up easily with soap and water. As it cures, the molecules become cross linked in a lattice-like pattern that is much more durable than the single-strand bonds formed by conventional water-based finishes. This makes it a good choice for high-wear interior applications such as tabletops. It will have a very slight shine to it.     Number of pieces included: 1    Additional Dimensions:   Seat Height 30\"       Back Rest Height 16\"    Color: Wood is a natural material that varies in color, grain pattern and over-all appearance and texture. While our product images are intended to represent a wide spectrum of a materials and meant to display various characteristics, they do not show all variations. Each piece has its own individual characteristics; no item is exactly the same although we do keep the colors schemes consistent.

The shape is evocative, obtained by the use of advanced technologies and a taste for artisan detailing. Beato Pouf and Pacifico Table fully satisfy the use they were designed for. They have a strong symbolic value that actually dilutes their seemingly ironic and \u201cpeaceful\u201d appearance. The head, symbol of a faraway culture, is used in a new way as seating, becoming an easy and versatile piece of furniture.

They form as cavities inside hardened volcanic or sedimentary rock, when groundwater minerals seep in to grow crystals. Agate tones and strengthens body and mind, as well as imparting a sense of strength and courage. It enhances creativity and stimulates the intellect. Agate is calming and soothing, and can dispel feelings of jealousy. These incredibly beautiful Brazilian agate geode bookends have been dyed a bright blue, and have been polished along the 2 cut sides to show off the beauty and depth of the agate stone. The bookends are matched pairs, cut from the same stone. Each bookend measures between 5 and 6 inches tall, 3 to 3 1\/2 inches wide and 2 1\/2-3 inches deep. They weigh approximately 3 pounds apiece. Since these geodes are natural rocks, taking millions of years to form, there will be slight differences in size and shape from the ones pictured.","shipment_cost":"","shipment_term":"Ready to ship to the Continental U.S. in 1 - 3  days.","seller":{"id":"1814","name":"Zeckos","houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/products\/buy-on-houzz\/seller--Zeckos"},"images":["http:\/\/st.houzz.com\/simgs\/0dc1006704844f96_4-1623\/traditional-bookends.jpg"],"properties":{"Category":"Bookends","Manufactured By":"Zeckos","Sold By":"Zeckos","Style":"Traditional"}},{"id":"380296","categories":[],"houzz_url":"http:\/\/www.houzz.com\/photos\/14637789\/Birdcage-Bookends-Set-of-2-eclectic-bookends","name":"Birdcage Bookends - Set of 2","price":"51.27","currency":"USD","description":"Finished in robin's egg blue, the Birdcage bookends are topped with fleur-de-lis embellishments and look great on any shelf.
